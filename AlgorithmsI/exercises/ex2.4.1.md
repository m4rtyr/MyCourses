Q: Suppose that the sequence `P R I O * R * * I * T * Y * * * Q U E * * * U * E`
(where a letter means *insert* and an asterisk means *remove the maximum*) is
applied to an initially empty priority queue. Give the sequence of letters
returned by the *remove the maximum* operations.

A: `R R P O T Y I I U Q E U`
